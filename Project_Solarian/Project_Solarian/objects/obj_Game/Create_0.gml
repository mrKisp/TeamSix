	I figure that we will create a series of resources that the player collects across both the

	I figure that we can use the obj_Game to manage all the resources.

//Upgrades
/*
	This could be handled with the ship or player pilot object, but I think it's possible that we can use 
	it here	in the event that we want a space that the player offloads in order to upgrade the ship. 
	For example, if there is a hangar on earth. 
	
	Can also cover other upgrades. Like a piercing ammo upgrade, warp upgrades, or whatever.
