Project Solarian - Real World Value

The project Solarian has real world value in the lessons that it will teach the player about the solar system. From how it feels to walk around a world with much very different gravity compared to Earth, to the chemical composition of the planets of the solar system, Project Solarian is going to help teach the player what our solar system is made of by just letting them explore and get familiar with things. 

As the player explores, they encounter real stellar chemistry, real stellar gravity, and other stellar concepts that help the player get used to the solar system around them. Then, when they go out to look at the stars in the sky and note that Mars is Red, they will be able to identify why it is red (Hint, it's due to iron content in the Martian Soil). 

The player isn't just handed the information in a large text dump. The gameplay loop begins from the beginning about exploring and investigating the worlds around them. As they begin to explore the worlds to find resources, they will build their codex of journal entries and uncover the real world science around them. As The alpha and beta expand on this, the player will begin to feel the world around them come to life as they explore and uncover. They will be presented with various choices on how to proceed, and they will be able to have fun and enjoy the experience of building their ship (or space station) with what they find. They will experience the growth of the world around them as they build their own knowledge of the solar system!
